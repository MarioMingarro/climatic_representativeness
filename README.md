# Climate representativeness

This repository has been created to facilitate the identification of the climatic representativeness of an area, be it a protected area or a species range.
It is composed of several phases.
1. Creation of climatic variables.
2. Estimation of the climatic representativeness based on the mahalanobis distance.
3. Identification of recipient areas. That is, location of the places where the climatic conditions currently hosted by the protected area will occur in the future.
4. Creation of corridors, using the mahalanobis distance as a resistance matrix, between the current area and the recipient area.
